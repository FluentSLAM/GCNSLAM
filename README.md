This is simple rework of [ChebNet](https://github.com/hazdzz/ChebyNet/) with simple data generator for localization problem on weighted undirected graph.

Maximum accuracy achieved is 0.81 for simple dataset with little noise on measurements.

This repo is currently archived due to inefficiency of GPU usage of [original](https://github.com/hazdzz/ChebyNet/) code. 

Mini-batching is not supported. Better implementations (probably including libraries like torch-geometric will be presented in separate repo.
